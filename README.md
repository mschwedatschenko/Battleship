# Battleship
Simple in-terminal battleship game

I made this in high school as part of a class project :)

To play battleship, 2 players secretly add ships of various lengths to their individual boards. A ship may be placed horizontally or vertically on the board. Players then take turns to try and shoot the ships on each other's boards by choosing a row and column reference for each attempted shot. When a player chooses a square containing a ship, that square is marked as a "hit".
